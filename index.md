Welcome!

This is a blog for the class ST 5558. I'll mostly be blogging about R and the use of R in the context of data science. 

<br>A little bit about me: 
1. I graduted from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a double major in mathematics and statistics. 
2. I'm currely pursuing a master's degree at NCSU in statistics. 
3. I currently work for Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico for the summer as a statistical intern.

I may be contacted using the following:

My research interests are Bayesian inferencing and conformal prediction and other black-box machine learning topics, as well as applications in statistical genomics.

Other than my academics, I also am a guitarist and an artist; I really enjoy watercolor painting, sewing and embroidery, and playing with my dog, Lily.
