Welcome!

This is a blog for the class ST 5558. I'll mostly be blogging about R and the use of R in the context of data science. 
A little bit about me: I graduted from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a double major in mathematics and statistics. I'm currely pursuing a master's degree at NCSU in statistics. I currently work for Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico for the summer as a statistical intern.
